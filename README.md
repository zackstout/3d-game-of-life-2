# Game of Life in 3D
The aim is to build a 3d visualization of Conway's Game of Life. Time can be represented by the vertical axis, so that as the program progresses from state to state, the new pattern of live cells is rendered a bit higher than the previous state. I am excited to see the kind of structures that will emerge from playing around with this. It also seems like a fun way to learn [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

Currently have the two-dimensional version of the simulation working.

## Built With
- three.js
